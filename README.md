<B>Different ways for selecting features</B>

Feature Selection is an important step in any data science Project and its specially important where we have high correlation between independent 
features or there are large no of features which can bring down the efficiency of the model.

Here we present below techniques for feature Selection
1. Univariate Selection
Univariate Selection involves using statistical measures to select the features

2. Wrapper Methods
Wrapper methods uses greedy search algorithms to recursively select the features
